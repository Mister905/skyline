A Brief History Of Dubai
Way back in 1833, Dubai had started off as a small settlement by some 800 members of the Bani Yas tribe, who were attracted to the natural harbour created by the creek flowing through Dubai. They turned the area into a small center for fishing and pearling. These people were later joined by the Arabian nomads of the Middle East called Bedouins. They too settled near the creek in small houses known as barastis.

During the 1960s, Dubaiâ€™s economy was merely dependent on the revenues generated from trade and oil exploration concessions. The history of Dubai development shows that when a major chunk of revenue obtained from oil reserves started to flow in 1969, Dubai started developing rapidly. Vast sums of cash were thrown into the picture, and major infrastructure like schools and hospitals started developing swiftly. Over the years, it transformed Dubai into the glam and glitzy hub we know today.

The primary highway linking Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed Road is the longest road in the Emirates. The construction of this massive road had begun back in 1971, and it took over nine long years to complete it. Known as the Defence Road back in those days, this road network is now bounded by various important buildings and areas of Dubai, including the Emirates Towers, Palm Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina.
