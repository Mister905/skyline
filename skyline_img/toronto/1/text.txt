In the 1930s, the Commerce Court building was the tallest visible on the Toronto skyline in Canada. 

However today, the building isn't even visible from the shores of Lake Ontario as it is covered by the Royal York Hotel, which was erected shortly after this image was taken.

Since the black and white, grainy image was taken, the city has seen major construction take place with the likes of the CN Tower erected in 1976, the Toronto City Hall inaugurated in 1965 and the Trump International Hotel and Tower built in 2012.
